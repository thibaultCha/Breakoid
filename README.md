## How to
1. Take a canvas:
```html
<canvas id="canvasid" width="500" height="400">
  Your browser does not support the canvas element.
</canvas>
```

2. Include breakoid.js and write:
```javascript
var breakoid = new Breakoid('canvasid');
```

3. Press `S` to start, `R` to reload, `P` to pause or resume the game.

* Breakoïd calculates your bricks width according to the canvas's width, the number of columns (NBCOLS) and the space between bricks (EMPTY_SPACE).
* Try to play with Breakoïd's constants to customize the game.
